# Introduction

[<img src="img1.jpg" width="300"/>](img1.jpg)

You might be wondering why is this painting of a dog the first thing I see on a developer's page? 

During the first week of my taking the *CSE 110: Software Engineering* course at UC San Diego, when I was sharing my hobbies with Professor Thomas Powell, he told me:
> I think we CS types are more varied than we like to admit and that partially keeps us from stretching and doing things we might or should do

And it is true. ~~STEM majors breathe STEM in place of air and drink STEM in place of water~~

There is much more to being a technical major than just coding, debugging, testing, or developing. I painted this image a couple of years ago and it reminds me of what I like to do in my spare time and that I am good at it. It is important to pursue a hobby as much as it is important to pursue a career.

## About

Hi ðŸ™‚

I am **Yash Shah**, a sophomore at UC San Diego. Currently, I am pursuing a major in Computer Science. My interests lie in learning algorithms and developing programs in the related fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 

As you might have guessed from the Introduction, I love to paint in my spare time. Apart from painting, I also love to read books - epics, philosophy, history, fantasy, adventure, and what not!

I would love to connect with you all, talk with you about what you like to do in your spare time, what ae your academic interests, or just to talk in general. You can also talk with me about what you liked in this page (, or what you did not like ðŸ¤«).

Here are links to my LinkedIn profile and GitHub repositories...

## Projects

Projects that I am proud of are:

1. [Library Management System](https://github.com/ynshah3/Library-Management-System)
   - This program uses SQL to maintain a database of the details of books in the library and of the issuers of books from the library
   - Used PyMySQL to use SQL within Python and connect to a local host (on my computer)
   - The user (continuing as admin) has privileges that allow him to add or remove book from the library, get a list of all books, get details about a particular book, get information about customers who have issued books but haven't returned yet, etc
   - The user (continuing as customer)can check which books are available based on a particular genre of books, issue books, and return books
   
2. [Tick Tack Toe](https://github.com/ynshah3/Tick-Tack-Toe)
   - Implemented the classic game of Tick Tack Toe, played through the command line
   - The user has the option of playing the game with another user (a two-player game) or to play with the computer (using Artificial Intelligence)
   - When playing with the computer, the user has the option to play with a beginner AI that uses random moves, an intermediate AI that makes winning moves and prevents losing moves, and a trained AI (using Minimax Algorithm, optimzed using Alpha Beta Pruning) that never loses

## Conclusion

Thank you so much for taking the time to visit my page and to navigate and be here till the end. I promise to keep this site up-to-date with my [Projects](#projects) and [Goals](#goals). I also promise to update the [About](#about) whenever there is a change in me, my hobbies, or my ideologies (*You have to accept the fact that we are humans and we change*). You know where to find me if you want me to see your GitHub page (~~so that I can hack it~~ to admire it and take inspiration from it).

Bye!
